## SQLHelper


</div>

### Description

This code will blaze through creating even the longest SQL statements(Jet supports up to 64K). This is an updated version of the SQLHelper post I made about six or so months ago, with various optimizations made since then. I have found it to be very useful, hopefully you can too! All code was written by me and is free for all purposes with the exception of cStringBuilder.cls, which is from vbaccelerator.com.
